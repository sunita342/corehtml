        A full stack web stack is the collection of software used for web development that incorporates, at a minimum, an operating system (OS), a programming language, database software and a web server.
        
        A full stack web stack, also known as a web application stack, is a type of solution stack. There are two main types of full web stacks: front-end, back-end . Each type is powered by its own set of tools. Depending on the project, all three types may be required. At the very least, both front-end and back-end tools are essential to build web apps.

    <ul> <li>html</li><dl> A standard markup language to create web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and instructs browsers on how to display the page content.</dl>
    <li>css </li> <dl>A rule-based language that describes how HTML elements are displayed on a user's screen. It determines how the static elements of the front end will be presented, including fonts, element size, layouts and colors.</dl>
    <li>javascript</li> <dl>A scripting language to create interactive and dynamic web page content.</dl>
    <li>front-end user interface framework</li> <dl>These are required to build modern, user-driven websites and web applications. React, Vue.js, Angular and Ember.js are among the most popular UI frameworks for front-end web developers.</dl>
<li>css preprocesser</li><dl>These programs, or extension languages such as SASS or LESS, simplify CSS development by compiling code and creating a CSS file from their own unique syntax. The file can then be referenced by the main HTML document.
